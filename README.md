Learned to convert the time from milliseconds to the correct minute, seconds and milliseconds.

Learned to add, play and adjust sound volume into a Javascript project.

Creating an old fashioned looking computer mointer appearance. This article was gave me the idea to use a radial gradient to simulate the CRT screen.
